            Head off to the beautiful Koggala lake, immortalized by the famous Sri Lankan writer Martin Wickramasinghe by vehicle. Once there, take a scenic boat ride to discover the pristine mangrove ecosystem of the lake and its abundant birdlife. Make your way to the jetty to discover the village of Koggala by a Tuk Tuk, ride through the lush green village and its paddy & cinnamon cultivation. Stop at a cinnamon plantation and discover the process behind its harvesting. Did you know Sri Lanka produces more than 75% of the world's Cinnamon? Finish the experience with a refreshing Cinnamon Tea and Kithul Hakuru (A palmyra-based jaggery). Continue onto a sustainable local farm that grows fresh veggies and fruits like papaya, passion fruit, mango, chili, tomato, and drumsticks â€“ these local ingredients will likely be used for your lunch prepared at a local village mud house where you will get a brief demonstration on how these curries are cooked using traditional methods passed down through generations.
